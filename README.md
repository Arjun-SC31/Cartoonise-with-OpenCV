# Cartoonise-with-OpenCV

Apply a bilateral filter to reduce the range of colours to give it that cartoon-ish look

Convert the original image to the greyscale

Apply a median blur to reduce the image noise in the resulting greyscale image

Recognise and create edges from the greyscale image using adaptive thresholding

Now finally combine the colour image from the first step, to edged image in the previous step.
